# Contingency Contract

Built to showcase my projects. Design inspired by
[Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/) UI with sharp contrast that feels
like a terminal screen.

## Philosophy

Bold layouts, readable typography, and just enough motion. This site focuses on
visual contrast and smooth transitions, so the content stays readable while
still feeling alive. Motion is used sparingly to guide attention rather than
decorate to make content feel operational, not ornamental.

## Tech Stack

- [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/): The Progressive JavaScript Framework
